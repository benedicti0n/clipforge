# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing video clipper application by adding comprehensive video editing capabilities to Step 2. After users clip a video in Step 1, they can proceed to Step 2 for advanced editing including automatic subtitle generation, fine-tuned trimming with visual controls, and text overlay functionality. This transforms the application from a simple clipper into a complete video editing tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to automatically generate subtitles for my clipped video, so that I can make my content accessible and engaging without manual transcription work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to Step 2 with a clipped video THEN the system SHALL display an option to generate subtitles automatically
2. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Subtitles" THEN the system SHALL process the video audio and extract speech-to-text transcription
3. WHEN subtitle generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the generated subtitles in an editable format with timestamps
4. WHEN subtitles are generated THEN the system SHALL allow users to edit subtitle text, timing, and positioning
5. IF subtitle generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow manual subtitle entry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want fine-tuned trimming controls with visual feedback, so that I can precisely adjust the start and end points of my clip beyond the initial rough cut.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in Step 2 THEN the system SHALL display a video timeline with draggable start and end markers
2. WHEN a user drags the start or end markers THEN the system SHALL update the video preview in real-time
3. WHEN a user adjusts trimming controls THEN the system SHALL display the current timestamp and duration
4. WHEN trimming adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL allow users to preview the exact segment before final processing
5. WHEN a user confirms trimming changes THEN the system SHALL re-process the video with the new boundaries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to add custom text overlays to my video, so that I can include titles, captions, or branding without external editing software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in Step 2 THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add text overlays
2. WHEN a user adds a text overlay THEN the system SHALL allow customization of text content, font size, color, and position
3. WHEN positioning text overlays THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop functionality on the video preview
4. WHEN configuring text overlays THEN the system SHALL allow users to set start and end times for when the text appears
5. WHEN multiple text overlays are added THEN the system SHALL manage layering and prevent conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview all my edits (subtitles, trimming, overlays) together before final processing, so that I can ensure the final video meets my expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has made edits in Step 2 THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive preview showing all changes
2. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL display subtitles, text overlays, and trimmed boundaries simultaneously
3. WHEN the user is satisfied with the preview THEN the system SHALL provide a "Process Final Video" option
4. WHEN final processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL combine all edits into a single output video
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download options for the final video

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the editing interface to be intuitive and responsive, so that I can efficiently make changes without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Step 2 interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators for all interactive elements
2. WHEN making edits THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for user actions
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN processing videos THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated completion times
5. IF the user navigates away during processing THEN the system SHALL preserve the current state and allow resumption

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to maintain the video quality and format consistency, so that my edited videos are suitable for sharing and distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing edited videos THEN the system SHALL maintain the original video quality and resolution
2. WHEN adding subtitles and overlays THEN the system SHALL ensure text is crisp and readable
3. WHEN exporting the final video THEN the system SHALL provide format options (MP4, WebM) suitable for web sharing
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL optimize the video for fast loading and playback
5. IF the original video has specific codec requirements THEN the system SHALL preserve compatibility
